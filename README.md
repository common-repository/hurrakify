## What is Hurrakify for? ##


Hurrakify is a plugin for wordpress.
Hurrakify adds tooltips to your blog articles. The plugin gets the tooltips from the Easy-to-read / Plain Language Dictionary Hurraki. Right now the Dictionary is available in three languages. ([English](http://hurraki.org/english/), [Spanish](http://hurraki.org/espanol) and [German](http://hurraki.de).) So inside the plugin you can choose between three dictionarys. 

You will find the working Plugin over at the [Wordpress Plugin Site](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hurrakify/)
